"""sync_ui.py — populate ./interface/ from canonical ../esp-rack/ui/.

Convenience: the consumer drops a single PWA icon at
    interface_overrides/public/app/icon.png
and sync auto-generates the matching `favicon.ico` (PNG wrapped in an
ICO container — every modern browser accepts that). A separate
favicon.ico file is honoured if explicitly placed. If Pillow is
available the icon is also auto-downscaled to TARGET_ICON_SIZE so a
2048×2048 download doesn't bloat the firmware bundle by ~1 MB; the
original in overrides/ is left untouched, only the copy that lands
in interface/ gets resized.

Architectural contract: the React frontend lives ONLY in the library
(esp-rack/ui/). The demo has zero per-service React — every C++ service
declares its UI via FormBuilder/WebFeatureSpec, and the library renders
dynamically. So the consumer's `interface/` is a build artefact, not a
source of truth.

This script is the bridge: pre:build it copies the library tree into
`./interface/` so build_interface.py can run npm against a complete
project. Re-running is idempotent.

The consumer can override individual files by dropping them under
./interface_overrides/ — that overlay is applied AFTER the library
copy. The script ALSO mirrors the lib's `public/` directory shape into
./interface_overrides/ on first run, so the consumer sees pre-made
empty target directories and knows where to drop project-branding
assets (icon.png, favicon.ico, theme overrides) without first reading
this source. Existing files inside overrides are NEVER touched — only
missing dirs are created.

Failure modes:
  * `../esp-rack/ui/` missing -> fail fast with a clear message.
  * `interface/node_modules` and `interface/build` are PRESERVED
    across syncs (npm install + webpack output, expensive to redo).
